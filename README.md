# Basic jQuery with ExpressJS Server

To run this, make sure you have NodeJS installed. If not, go to http://www.nodejs.org and download it.

After you have nodejs installed, run `git clone https://github.com/FreeCodeCampTucson/basic-jquery-with-server.git` 

After it is finished cloning, navigate into that folder on the command line and run `node server.js` and the server should start.

### Pro-tip: Normally, you don't want to push the "node_modules" folder to Github because it's so big and easy to download on your local machine with NPM.
